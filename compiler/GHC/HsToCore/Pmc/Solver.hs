Note [Implementation of COMPLETE pragmas]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A COMPLETE set represents a set of conlikes (i.e., constructors or
pattern synonyms) such that if they are all pattern-matched against in a
function, it gives rise to a total function. An example is:

  newtype Boolean = Boolean Int
  pattern F, T :: Boolean
  pattern F = Boolean 0
  pattern T = Boolean 1
  {-# COMPLETE F, T #-}

  -- This is a total function
  booleanToInt :: Boolean -> Int
  booleanToInt F = 0
  booleanToInt T = 1

COMPLETE sets are represented internally in GHC a set of 'ConLike's. For
example, the pragma {-# COMPLETE F, T #-} would be represented as:

  {F, T}

GHC collects all COMPLETE pragmas from the current module and from imports
into a field in the DsM environment, which can be accessed with
dsGetCompleteMatches from "GHC.HsToCore.Monad".
Currently, COMPLETE pragmas can't be orphans (e.g. at least one ConLike must
also be defined in the module of the pragma) and do not impact recompilation
checking (#18675).

The pattern-match checker will then initialise each variable's 'VarInfo' with
*all* imported COMPLETE sets (in 'GHC.HsToCore.Pmc.Solver.addCompleteMatches'),
well-typed or not, into a 'ResidualCompleteMatches'. The trick is that a
COMPLETE set that is ill-typed for that match variable could never be written by
the user! And we make sure not to report any ill-typed COMPLETE sets when
formatting 'Nabla's for warnings in 'generateInhabitingPatterns'.

A 'ResidualCompleteMatches' is a list of all COMPLETE sets, minus the ConLikes
we know a particular variable can't be (through negative constructor constraints
@x /~ K@ or a failed attempt at instantiating that ConLike during inhabitation
testing). If *any* of the COMPLETE sets become empty, we know that the match
was exhaustive.

We assume that a COMPLETE set is non-empty if for one of its ConLikes
we fail to 'guessConLikeUnivTyArgsFromResTy'. That accounts for ill-typed
COMPLETE sets. So why don't we simply prune those ill-typed COMPLETE sets from
'ResidualCompleteMatches'? The answer is that additional type constraints might
make more COMPLETE sets applicable! Example:

  f :: a -> a :~: Boolean -> ()
  f x Refl | T <- x = ()
           | F <- x = ()

If we eagerly prune {F,T} from the residual matches of @x@, then we don't see
that the match in the guards of @f@ is exhaustive, where the COMPLETE set
applies due to refined type information.

{- Note [Type normalisation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Constructs like -XEmptyCase or a previous unsuccessful pattern match on a data
constructor place a non-void constraint on the matched thing. This means that it
boils down to checking whether the type of the scrutinee is inhabited. Function
pmTopNormaliseType gets rid of the outermost type function/data family redex and
newtypes, in search of an algebraic type constructor, which is easier to check
for inhabitation.

It returns 3 results instead of one, because there are 2 subtle points:
1. Newtypes are isomorphic to the underlying type in core but not in the source
   language,
2. The representational data family tycon is used internally but should not be
   shown to the user

Hence, if pmTopNormaliseType env ty_cs ty = Just (src_ty, dcs, core_ty),
then
  (a) src_ty is the rewritten type which we can show to the user. That is, the
      type we get if we rewrite type families but not data families or
      newtypes.
  (b) dcs is the list of newtype constructors "skipped", every time we normalise
      a newtype to its core representation, we keep track of the source data
      constructor. For convenience, we also track the type we unwrap and the
      type of its field. Example: @Down 42@ => @[(Down @Int, Down, Int)]
  (c) core_ty is the rewritten type. That is,
        pmTopNormaliseType env ty_cs ty = Just (src_ty, dcs, core_ty)
      implies
        topNormaliseType_maybe env ty = Just (co, core_ty)
      for some coercion co.

To see how all cases come into play, consider the following example:

  data family T a :: *
  data instance T Int = T1 | T2 Bool
  -- Which gives rise to FC:
  --   data T a
  --   data R:TInt = T1 | T2 Bool
  --   axiom ax_ti : T Int ~R R:TInt

  newtype G1 = MkG1 (T Int)
  newtype G2 = MkG2 G1

  type instance F Int  = F Char
  type instance F Char = G2

In this case pmTopNormaliseType env ty_cs (F Int) results in

  Just (G2, [(G2,MkG2,G1),(G1,MkG1,T Int)], R:TInt)

Which means that in source Haskell:
  - G2 is equivalent to F Int (in contrast, G1 isn't).
  - if (x : R:TInt) then (MkG2 (MkG1 x) : F Int).

-----
-- Wrinkle: Local equalities
-----

Given the following type family:

  type family F a
  type instance F Int = Void

Should the following program (from #14813) be considered exhaustive?

  f :: (i ~ Int) => F i -> a
  f x = case x of {}

You might think "of course, since `x` is obviously of type Void". But the
idType of `x` is technically F i, not Void, so if we pass F i to
inhabitationCandidates, we'll mistakenly conclude that `f` is non-exhaustive.
In order to avoid this pitfall, we need to normalise the type passed to
pmTopNormaliseType, using the constraint solver to solve for any local
equalities (such as i ~ Int) that may be in scope.

{- Note [Coverage checking Newtype matches]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Newtypes have quite peculiar match semantics compared to ordinary DataCons. In a
pattern-match, they behave like a irrefutable (lazy) match, but for inhabitation
testing purposes (e.g. at construction sites), they behave rather like a DataCon
with a *strict* field, because they don't contribute their own bottom and are
inhabited iff the wrapped type is inhabited.

This distinction becomes apparent in #17248:

  newtype T2 a = T2 a
  g _      True = ()
  g (T2 _) True = ()
  g !_     True = ()

If we treat Newtypes like we treat regular DataCons, we would mark the third
clause as redundant, which clearly is unsound. The solution:
1. 'isPmAltConMatchStrict' returns False for newtypes, indicating that a
   newtype match is lazy.
2. When we find @x ~ T2 y@, transfer all constraints on @x@ (which involve @⊥@)
   to @y@, similar to what 'equate' does, and don't add a @x ≁ ⊥@ constraint.
   This way, the third clause will still be marked as inaccessible RHS instead
   of redundant. This is ensured by calling 'lookupVarInfoNT'.
3. Immediately reject when we find @x ≁ T2@.
Handling of Newtypes is also described in the Appendix of the Lower Your Guards paper,
where you can find the solution in a perhaps more digestible format.

* @x ~ Nothing@, @x ≁ [Just]@. 'eqPmAltCon' returns @Disjoint@, so negative
  info is redundant and should be discarded.
* @x ~ I# y@, @x ≁ [4,2]@. 'eqPmAltCon' returns @PossiblyOverlap@, so orthogal.
  We keep this info in order to be able to refute a redundant match on i.e. 4
  later on.

This carries over to pattern synonyms and overloaded literals. Say, we have
    pattern Just42 = Just 42
    case Just42 of x
      Nothing -> ()
      Just _  -> ()
Even though we had a solution for the value abstraction called x here in form
of a PatSynCon Just42, this solution is incomparable to both Nothing and
Just. Hence we retain the info in vi_neg, which eventually allows us to detect
the complete pattern match.

The Pos/Neg invariant extends to vi_rcm, which essentially stores positive
information. We make sure that vi_neg and vi_rcm never overlap. This isn't
strictly necessary since vi_rcm is just a cache, so doesn't need to be
accurate: Every suggestion of a possible ConLike from vi_rcm might be
refutable by the type oracle anyway. But it helps to maintain sanity while
debugging traces.

Note [Why record both positive and negative info?]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You might think that knowing positive info (like x ~ Just y) would render
negative info irrelevant, but not so because of pattern synonyms.  E.g we might
know that x cannot match (Foo 4), where pattern Foo p = Just p

Also overloaded literals themselves behave like pattern synonyms. E.g if
postively we know that (x ~ I# y), we might also negatively want to record that
x does not match 45 f 45       = e2 f (I# 22#) = e3 f 45       = e4  --
Overlapped

Note [TmState invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The term oracle state is never obviously (i.e., without consulting the type
oracle or doing inhabitation testing) contradictory. This implies a few
invariants:
* Whenever vi_pos overlaps with vi_neg according to 'eqPmAltCon', we refute.
  This is implied by the Note [Pos/Neg invariant].
* Whenever vi_neg subsumes a COMPLETE set, we refute. We consult vi_rcm to
  detect this, but we could just compare whole COMPLETE sets to vi_neg every
  time, if it weren't for performance.

Maintaining these invariants in 'addVarCt' (the core of the term oracle) and
'addNotConCt' is subtle.
* Merging VarInfos. Example: Add the fact @x ~ y@ (see 'equate').
  - (COMPLETE) If we had @x ≁ True@ and @y ≁ False@, then we get
    @x ≁ [True,False]@. This is vacuous by matter of comparing to the built-in
    COMPLETE set, so should refute.
  - (Pos/Neg) If we had @x ≁ True@ and @y ~ True@, we have to refute.
* Adding positive information. Example: Add the fact @x ~ K ys@ (see 'addConCt')
  - (Neg) If we had @x ≁ K@, refute.
  - (Pos) If we had @x ~ K2@, and that contradicts the new solution according to
    'eqPmAltCon' (ex. K2 is [] and K is (:)), then refute.
  - (Refine) If we had @x ≁ K zs@, unify each y with each z in turn.
* Adding negative information. Example: Add the fact @x ≁ Nothing@ (see 'addNotConCt')
  - (Refut) If we have @x ~ K ys@, refute.
  - (COMPLETE) If K=Nothing and we had @x ≁ Just@, then we get
    @x ≁ [Just,Nothing]@. This is vacuous by matter of comparing to the built-in
    COMPLETE set, so should refute.

Note that merging VarInfo in equate can be done by calling out to 'addConCt' and
'addNotConCt' for each of the facts individually.

Note [Representation of Strings in TmState]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instead of treating regular String literals as a PmLits, we treat it as a list
of characters in the oracle for better overlap reasoning. The following example
shows why:

  f :: String -> ()
  f ('f':_) = ()
  f "foo"   = ()
  f _       = ()

The second case is redundant, and we like to warn about it. Therefore either
the oracle will have to do some smart conversion between the list and literal
representation or treat is as the list it really is at runtime.

The "smart conversion" has the advantage of leveraging the more compact literal
representation wherever possible, but is really nasty to get right with negative
equalities: Just think of how to encode @x /= "foo"@.
The "list" option is far simpler, but incurs some overhead in representation and
warning messages (which can be alleviated by someone with enough dedication).

Note [Detecting pattern synonym applications in expressions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the moment we fail to detect pattern synonyms in scrutinees and RHS of
guards. This could be alleviated with considerable effort and complexity, but
the returns are meager. Consider:

    pattern P
    pattern Q
    case P 15 of
      Q _  -> ...
      P 15 ->

Compared to the situation where P and Q are DataCons, the lack of generativity
means we could never flag Q as redundant. (also see Note [Undecidable Equality
for PmAltCons] in PmTypes.) On the other hand, if we fail to recognise the
pattern synonym, we flag the pattern match as inexhaustive. That wouldn't happen
if we had knowledge about the scrutinee, in which case the oracle basically
knows "If it's a P, then its field is 15".

This is a pretty narrow use case and I don't think we should to try to fix it
until a user complains energetically.

Note [Completeness checking with required Thetas]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the situation in #11224

    import Text.Read (readMaybe)
    pattern PRead :: Read a => () => a -> String
    pattern PRead x <- (readMaybe -> Just x)
    f :: String -> Int
    f (PRead x)  = x
    f (PRead xs) = length xs
    f _          = 0

Is the first match exhaustive on the PRead synonym? Should the second line thus
deemed redundant? The answer is, of course, No! The required theta is like a
hidden parameter which must be supplied at the pattern match site, so PRead
is much more like a view pattern (where behavior depends on the particular value
passed in).
The simple solution here is to forget in 'addNotConCt' that we matched
on synonyms with a required Theta like @PRead@, so that subsequent matches on
the same constructor are never flagged as redundant. The consequence is that
we no longer detect the actually redundant match in

    g :: String -> Int
    g (PRead x) = x
    g (PRead y) = y -- redundant!
    g _         = 0

But that's a small price to pay, compared to the proper solution here involving
storing required arguments along with the PmAltConLike in 'vi_neg'.

Note [Strict fields and variables of unlifted type]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Binders of unlifted type (and strict fields) are unlifted by construction;
they are conceived with an implicit @≁⊥@ constraint to begin with. Hence,
desugaring in "GHC.HsToCore.Pmc" is entirely unconcerned by strict fields,
since the forcing happens *before* pattern matching.
And the φ constructor constraints emitted by 'GHC.HsToCore.Pmc.checkGrd'
have complex binding semantics (binding type constraints and unlifted fields),
so unliftedness semantics are entirely confined to the oracle.

These are the moving parts:

  1.  For each strict (or more generally, unlifted) field @s@ of a 'PhiConCt'
      we have to add a @s ≁ ⊥@ constraint in the corresponding case of
      'addPhiTmCt'. Strict fields are devoid of ⊥ by construction, there's
      nothing that a bang pattern would act on. Example from #18341:

        data T = MkT !Int
        f :: T -> ()
        f (MkT  _) | False = () -- inaccessible
        f (MkT !_) | False = () -- redundant, not only inaccessible!
        f _                = ()

      The second clause desugars to @MkT n <- x, !n@. When coverage checked,
      the 'PmCon' @MkT n <- x@ refines the set of values that reach the bang
      pattern with the φ constraints @MkT n <- x@ (Nothing surprising so far).
      Upon that constraint, it disperses into two lower-level δ constraints
      @x ~ MkT n, n ≁ ⊥@ per Equation (3) in Figure 7 of the paper.

      Checking the 'PmBang' @!n@ will then try to add the
      constraint @n ~ ⊥@ to this set to get the diverging set, which is found
      to be empty. Hence the whole clause is detected as redundant, as
      expected.

  2.  Similarly, when performing the 'inhabitationTest', when instantiating a
      constructor we call 'instCon', which generates a higher-level φ
      constructor constraint.

  3.  The preceding points handle unlifted constructor fields, but there also
      are regular binders of unlifted type.
      Since the oracle as implemented has no notion of scoping and bindings,
      we can't know *when* an unlifted variable comes into scope. But that's
      not actually a problem, because we can just add the @x ≁ ⊥@ to the
      'emptyVarInfo' when we first encounter it.

{- Note [Fuel for the inhabitation test]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whether or not a type is inhabited is undecidable in general. As a result, we
can run into infinite loops in `inhabitationTest`. Therefore, we adopt a
fuel-based approach to prevent that.

Consider the following example:

  data Abyss = MkAbyss !Abyss
  stareIntoTheAbyss :: Abyss -> a
  stareIntoTheAbyss x = case x of {}

In principle, stareIntoTheAbyss is exhaustive, since there is no way to
construct a terminating value using MkAbyss. But this can't be proven by mere
instantiation and requires an inductive argument, which `inhabitationTest`
currently isn't equipped to do.

In order to prevent endless instantiation attempts in @inhabitationTest@, we
use the fuel as an upper bound such attempts.

The same problem occurs with recursive newtypes, like in the following code:

  newtype Chasm = MkChasm Chasm
  gazeIntoTheChasm :: Chasm -> a
  gazeIntoTheChasm x = case x of {} -- Erroneously warned as non-exhaustive

So this limitation is somewhat understandable.

Note that even with this recursion detection, there is still a possibility that
`inhabitationTest` can run in exponential time in the amount of fuel. Consider
the following data type:

  data T = MkT !T !T !T

If we try to instantiate each of its fields, that will require us to once again
check if `MkT` is inhabitable in each of those three fields, which in turn will
require us to check if `MkT` is inhabitable again... As you can see, the
branching factor adds up quickly, and if the initial fuel is, say,
100, then the inhabiation test will effectively take forever.

To mitigate this, we check the branching factor every time we are about to do
inhabitation testing in 'instCon'. If the branching factor exceeds 1
(i.e., if there is potential for exponential runtime), then we limit the
maximum recursion depth to 1 to mitigate the problem. If the branching factor
is exactly 1 (i.e., we have a linear chain instead of a tree), then it's okay
to stick with a larger maximum recursion depth.

In #17977 we saw that the defaultRecTcMaxBound (100 at the time of writing) was
too large and had detrimental effect on performance of the coverage checker.
Given that we only commit to a best effort anyway, we decided to substantially
decrement the fuel to 4, at the cost of precision in some edge cases
like

  data Nat = Z | S Nat
  data Down :: Nat -> Type where
    Down :: !(Down n) -> Down (S n)
  f :: Down (S (S (S (S (S Z))))) -> ()
  f x = case x of {}

Since the coverage won't bother to instantiate Down 4 levels deep to see that it
is in fact uninhabited, it will emit a inexhaustivity warning for the case.

Note [DataCons that are definitely inhabitable]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another microoptimization applies to data types like this one:

  data S a = S ![a] !T

Even though there is a strict field of type [a], it's quite silly to call
'instCon' on it, since it's "obvious" that it is inhabitable. To make this
intuition formal, we say that a DataCon C is definitely inhabitable (DI) if:

  1. C has no equality constraints (since they might be unsatisfiable)
  2. C has no strict arguments (since they might be uninhabitable)
  3. C has no unlifted argument types (since they might be uninhabitable)

It's relatively cheap to check if a DataCon is DI, so before we call 'instCon'
on a constructor of a COMPLETE set, we filter out all of the DI ones.

This fast path shaves down -7% allocations for PmSeriesG, for example.

{- Note [Why inhabitationTest doesn't call generateInhabitingPatterns]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Why can't we define `inhabitationTest` (IT) in terms of
`generateInhabitingPatterns` (GIP) as

  inhabitationTest nabla = do
    nablas <- lift $ generateInhabitingPatterns all_variables 1 nabla
    guard (notNull nablas)

There are a few technical reasons, like the lack of a fuel-tracking approach
to stay decidable, that could be overcome. But the nail in the coffin is
performance: In order to provide good warning messages, GIP commits to *one*
COMPLETE set, and goes through some hoops to find the minimal one. This implies
it has to look at *all* constructors in the residual COMPLETE matches and see if
they match, if only to filter out ill-typed COMPLETE sets
(see Note [Implementation of COMPLETE pragmas]). That is untractable for an
efficient IT on huge enumerations.

But we still need GIP to produce the Nablas as proxies for
uncovered patterns that we display warnings for. It's fine to pay this price
once at the end, but IT is called far more often than that.
