    • Couldn't match type: IxMap i1
                     with: IxMap r
      Expected: IxMap (l :|: r) [Int]
        Actual: BiApp (IxMap i0) (IxMap i1) [Int]
      NB: ‘IxMap’ is a non-injective type family
      The type variable ‘i1’ is ambiguous
    • In the expression: BiApp empty empty
      In an equation for ‘empty’: empty = BiApp empty empty
      In the instance declaration for ‘Ix (l :|: r)’
    • Relevant bindings include
        empty :: IxMap (l :|: r) [Int] (bound at T2544.hs:19:4)
